# Wordle Canvas
[Wordle Canvas](https://jacobapimentel.github.io/WordleCanvas/) is a website where you can paint Wordle results. Color the tiles and generate the guesses that correspond with the painted pattern!

## User Guide
The site gives you a 5x6 grid that mimics the Wordle play area.
Use the toolbar to choose a color:
- Green, Yellow, or Black to paint tiles.
- The trash can clears the entire board.
- The cloud sync button fetches today's Wordle answer directly from nytimes.com.
- You can also type your own answer, as long as it is five alphabetical characters.

Once the grid reflects your desired pattern, click SOLVE to compute matching guesses.
- If no guesses can be determined for a row, it will display as "?????"

There are also keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch between the colors:
- 1 = green
- 2 = yellow
- 3 = black
